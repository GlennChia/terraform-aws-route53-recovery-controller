# AWS Route53 Application Recovery Controller Module

AWS Route53 Application Recovery Controller (ARC) is a set of capabilities that continuously monitors an applicationâ€™s ability to recover from failures and controls application recovery across multiple AWS Availability Zones, AWS Regions, and on premises environments to help you to build applications that must deliver very high availability.

This module can deploy the readiness resources and also routing control cluster resources. Much of this code was adapted from [this AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/running-recovery-oriented-applications-with-amazon-route-53-application-recovery-controller-aws-ci-cd-tools-and-terraform/) which can also provide more context on ARC design and terms.

## Usage

The primary configuration item is `cells_definition` which is a nested map that tells ARC which resources per region need to be added to ARC. Example usage below.

### Readiness Resources Only

The below `terraform.tfvars` file would be enough to add all readiness resources to an application deployed in ACTIVE/PASSIVE between us-east-1/us-west-2. The ACTIVE region is determined by your `provider` block or by `var.primary_cell_region`.

```terraform
name = "my-asg-elb-ddb-app"

cells_definition = {
  us-east-1 = {
    elasticloadbalancing = <arn>
    autoscaling          = <arn>
    dynamodb             = <arn>
    ec2-volume           = <arn>
  }
  us-west-2 = {
    elasticloadbalancing = <arn>
    autoscaling          = <arn>
    dynamodb             = <arn>
    ec2-volume           = <arn>
  }
}
```

### Routing Control Cluster Resources & R53 Alias Records

To define an ARC cluster for managed failover you should add the below values to as terraform variables.

```terraform
create_recovery_cluster = false

hosted_zone = {
  name         = "mycoolapp.com."
}
```

## Contributing to this Module

### Adding a new service

If any services are added to ARC or missing from this module, to include please make the module aware of the CFN Service Type by completing below steps:

1. add service to `var.resource_type_name` variable type definition
1. add service key (from 1) to validation check for `var.cells_definition` in variables.tf
